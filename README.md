## Software

On Mac OSX, which is based on a Unix environment, you can use the built in terminal program (found in the Utilities folder of the Applications folder).

Windows, which is not Unix based, does not come with a bash shell.  Please [install GitBash](https://workshops.rcs.northwestern.edu/install/bash/).
